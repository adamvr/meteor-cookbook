Refactoring MVC to Components  
=================================================

As mentioned elsewhere, for performance reasons, there's a general trend when building webapps to start with markup languages and to move towards pure javascript as the app becomes more mature.  If you find yourself struggling with styling and animations, and find yourself researching components/microservice based architectures (such as React, Famo.us, and the like), you may be ready to begin refactoring your MVC based app towards a component based app.

Below is a pattern that I use to prep apps to be rewritten using components.  In essence, what's described below is a stepping stone towards componentization, which continues to use the existing HTML and CSS subsystems.  The first step is to identify each component, and move it into it's own directory, and make sure the HTML/CSS/JS pattern is completed.

````sh
fooComponent/fooComponent.html
fooComponent/fooComponent.js
fooComponent/fooComponent.less
````

Once we've moved relevant files into a directory, start by identifying the boundary of each template/component.  We do that by creating a div inside the template with an id that is the same as the name of the component.  When compiled to DOM, this inner div will become ``firstNode`` or ``childNode[0]``, and will be explicitely named the same as the template (which would otherwise be invisible).  This explicit naming convention will become invaluable with any technologies that use CSS or XPATH selectors (such as jquery or selenium).   

````html
<template name="fooComponent">
  <div id="fooComponent">
      <widget id="barWidget"></widget>
  </div>
</template>
````

Our template JS object now has the same name as a DOM element in our HTML, as well as a directory and three files in our filesystem.  It helps to keep things organized if we go ahead and stub out the rest of the Template/Component.  Even if things are empty, we can see the component take shape.

````js
Router.route('/foo', {
  template: 'fooComponent'
});

Template.fooComponent.helpers({ ... });
Template.fooComponent.events({ ... });

Template.fooComponent.onRendered(function(){ ... });
Template.fooComponent.onCreated(function(){ ... });
Template.fooComponent.onDestroyed(function(){ ... });
````

Lastly - and this is one of the more important parts - we scope our styling to just the component in question, avoiding global namespace collisions, and making our styling consistent and reliable (and ready for mobile layouts, if necessary).  We do this by using the nested classes from ``.less``, which let us simulate local scoping of CSS classes.  

````less
#fooComponent{
  // add custom component classes here
  
  #barWidget{
  
  }

  // desktop specific layout for this component
  @media only screen and (min-width: 960px) { }

  // landscape orientation for this component
  @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) { }

  // portrait orientation for this component
  @media only screen and (min-width: 480px) { }
}
````

With this pattern in place, ``fooComponent`` is ready to be converted into a Blaze Component, Web Component, React View, or Famo.us View.  Typically, next steps will involve converting CSS into JSS; HTML into JSX, or otherwise translating HTML and CSS into pure javascript.
